## Welcome

Hello! If you've stumbled upon this page, hopefully it means you are interested in my research. This is currently a work in progress, and I hope to have more up here soon.

## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="LSRF_picture_cropped.jpg">

I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [Professor Edo Kussell](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/edo-kussell.html) in the Biology Department at New York University. Currently, I am very fortunate to be a [Simons Fellow](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-life-sciences/) of the [Life Sciences Research Foundation](http://www.lsrf.org/). Prior to working with Edo, I spent 5+ mind-bending years doing my PhD at Caltech under the mentorship of [Rustem Ismagilov](https://ismagilovlab.caltech.edu/).

## Research Interests

Biophysics, soft matter physics, polymer physics, computational biology, and evolution

## Research Summary

**Can we use physics to predict how polymers in our diet shape gut environment?**

During my [PhD thesis work](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/11474/), I focused on elucidating how polymers in the human diet influence gut structure and function through physicochemical interactions. The human gut abounds in both secreted polymers (e.g., mucus, proteins) and ingested polymers (e.g., dietary fibers, food additives, therapeutics). These polymers affect the composition of the gut microbiome and diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, yet the underlying physics by which these polymers alter gut physiology is not well understand. We studied this through a combination of experiments and numerical calculations. Despite the complexity of the gut, we were able to develop a coarse-grained, statistical physics approach for understanding how dietary polymers impact physiology, which enabled quantitative predictions based on measurables such as polymer size and concentration. Specifically, we found that dietary polymer-induced osmotic forces can compress colonic mucus and influence the aggregation of particles in the gut (Publications 2-4). Both mucus compression and aggregation have implications regarding altered protection against pathogens and drug uptake. Overall, my thesis work with the Ismagilov Lab yielded a quantitative, biophysical understanding of how polymer-driven osmotic forces, which shape gut physiology, can be tuned by host, microbiota, and diet.

**How do fluctuating, biopolymeric environments influence microbial adaptation and behavior?**

As the gut microbiota has a profound effect on human health, a complete understanding of how dietary polymers influence gut function must incorporate a quantitative framework for how microbes adapt to and behave in environments where conditions are constantly in flux and polymer-rich (e.g., gut, lungs). I began working on this at the end of my PhD with work focusing on how polymer-driven osmotic forces influence the aggregation of motile bacteria (Publication 1). I am now working with Edo Kussell to understand how microbes have adapted to live in these fluctuating, biopolymeric environments by leveraging diversity-generating mechanisms such as stochastic switching (i.e., phenotypic diversity) and recombination (i.e., genetic diversity).
